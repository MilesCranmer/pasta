    "## Neutron Stars\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Neutron Star** is one of three types of *zombie stars*, or, in more physically-apt terms, one of three types of *compact objects*. These three types of compact objects, which each form after the \"death\" of a normal star, are the black hole (BH), neutron star (NS), and white dwarf (WD). \n",
    "\n",
    "A star is said to die when it runs out of \"fuel\", and, because it is no longer pumping out thermal energy from its inside, it can no longer push out on itself, and collapses on its own gravity. When this gravity is too strong &mdash; when the mass of the dying star is too large,  a BH will form. In all other cases, this collapse will be stopped by something called *degeneracy pressure*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Degeneracy pressure** is a pressure that is caused by quantum mechanical principles, and is only encountered when particles are pushed to extreme densities. When particles are packed closely enough, as they are during the collapse of a star, we maintain the *Pauli exclusion principle*, meaning that particles in the same space can not be in the same quantum state. This means that particles, as they are shoved together, will have to make amends by increasing their energy to reach higher quantum states. The force pushing these particles to those higher states then pushes back against the collapse of the star, and gives what we then call degeneracy pressure. This state of matter is then referred to as *degenerate matter*. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two limits that are relevant to this discussion. The first is the [Chandrasekhar limit](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:astro-ph/0702351): $1.38 M_\\odot$. As a star collapses on itself, the core of the collapse will begin to resist the collapse with  degeneracy pressure. This pressure pushes back on the in-falling matter - forcing it to rebound off of this core. If the remaining matter is less than the Chandrasekhar limit, it is supported by *electron degeneracy pressure* - that is, degenerate pressure created by electrons. This forms a WD. For masses greater than this, the star will continue to collapse into a NS, where it is then supported against further collapse by *neutron degeneracy pressure*. The limit on the support of this is much more uncertain, with the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit putting it in the [range of $1.5\\text{-}3.0 M_\\odot$](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996A&A...305..871B). Further collapse will form a BH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observing these two limits during collapse, a NS, the most compact type of star in the universe, is left over from the original star. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason NSs are 'in fashion' nowadays, and the reason a near-30-year NS-lull was broken in the late 60's, is because of the discovery of the **pulsar**. A pulsar is, from our perspective, a regularly pulsing star in the sky. Sometimes these can pulse up to [716 times a second](https://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1123430). A pulsar is not little green men sending data packets, but in fact rotating neutron stars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutron stars emit light in a [hollow cone shape from their magnetic poles](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976ApJ...210..220O). As is also true with the Earth, pulsars have their magnetic pole offset from their spin axis - this means that as they spin, the beam of light moves across the universe, passing over us once every spin, much as a lighthouse illuminates a boat on every turn. \n",

    "## Equation of state\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one uncertainty in the research of neutron stars that remains as controversial as ever: the equation of state of dense nuclear matter. The equation of state is simply a specification of the set of relationships between such variables as mass, density, pressure, temperature, energy, and so on. As nuclear matter at densities of $\\gtrsim 10^{13}$ g cm$^3$ are rather difficult to create in experiment, physicists have used neutron stars as (very) remote laboratories to test the dense matter equations of state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are an infinite number of equations of state in a finite number of categories -- called families. \"Constraints\" are something applied to these families to reduce their size. Making observations of neutron stars (i.e., looking at them) gives us information about them, so that we can make inferences on the *true* equation of state of a neutron star, and thereby eliminate extraneous models from our theory. Pulsar timing to measure Keplarian parameters, allows us to fill in equations which can give us incredibly precise measurements on a NSs mass. The radius, however, is much more difficult to constrain, but these parameters together form a relationship that is the only aspect of the equation of state relevant to the total structure of a NS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different families of equations of state can be seen below, plotted on a [mass-radius graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02698).\n",
    "\n",
    "![2](http://i.imgur.com/olo2dEW.png \"Equations of state\")\n",
    "\n",
    "From what may be evident from this picture, we still have a long way to go in terms of understanding the way matter behaves at extremely high density. One of these mysteries lies in the NS crust, at densities of $\\sim 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$"

    "## Neutron Star Crust\n",
    "\n",
    "![3](http://i.imgur.com/UOKQeFP.png \"Crust structure\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The NS crust is about 1 km thick, and varies from densities of practically zero in the outer atmosphere, to $\\sim 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$ at the [inner mantle](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.4793). Despite being a fraction of the total mass of a neutron star, the crust has a much larger share of effects on the observations of neutron stars, and therefore is incredibly important to understand in making inferences about NSs and their various properties (see [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3955) for an excellent review).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This extremely high density causes matter to behave completely unlike it normally would. As done [previously](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ASSL..326.....H), a good way to describe this environment is to start from the surface of the NS, and go down. Starting from the outer crust of a NS, a density of about $10^4$ g/cm$^3$ produces matter which consists of a BCC lattice of iron plasma. Going further down, electron capture becomes more favourable, producing nuclei which are more neutron-rich. Reaching the inner crust, we reach the neutron-drip density of $\\rho_\\text{ND}\\sim 10^{11}$ g/cm$^3$, which causes the neutrons to quite literally \"drip\" out of the nuclei - producing free degenerate neutron. Passing the inner crust and entering the mantle, at around nuclear saturation density of up $\\rho_0 = 2.8\\times 10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$, we begin to see some incredibly strange effects..."

    "## Nuclear Pasta\n",
    "\n",
    "As we continue to move deeper in the crust of a neutron star, and as $\\rho \\rightarrow \\sim 10^{14}$g/cm$^3$ and beyond, we encounter what is called \"Coulomb Frustration\". This is what happens when nuclear forces and Coulomb repulsion begin to balance out, so that particles becomes *frustrated*. This term is used in many different disciplines for describing the existence of many different low-energy states. A proton, for instance, may have a difficult time deciding if it wants to join a cluster of other protons for the nuclear attraction, or stay far back for the Coulomb repulsion, and so it is frustrated. This effect leads to the formation of interesting topologies known collectively as **Nuclear Pasta**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we move through the top of the mantle, nuclei begin to become non-spherical. They begin to form into long rods of nuclei surrounded by the neutron sea - what are called *Nuclear Spaghetti*. Even deeper into the mantle, these rods fuse together, and form slabs, which are then called *Nuclear Lasagna*. Deeper still, at greater densities, the lasagna fuses to create uniform nuclear bulk matter with long holes of neutron superfluid - the *Nuclear Bucatini*. Finally, we are left with simple holes of neutron superfluid, giving the term *Nuclear Swiss Cheese*. At even greater densities, the nuclei \"dissolve\" into the neutron sea, transitioning into the superfluid core."

    "## Current Nuclear Pasta research\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows are examples of some current areas in nuclear pasta research. As astronomers learn more about the importance of pasta in influencing various properties of the neutron star, these research areas will continue to see expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "The topology of Nuclear Pasta refers to its shape. The different phases, their prevalance, and precisely how they are shaped are all subjects of current research. One particularly important question in the topology of nuclear pasta refers to the frequency of \"defects\". For example, in nuclear lasagna, between the sheets there are occasional helical ramps - things that are shaped like [parking-garage ramps](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00410), and form passages between two adjacent nucleonic planes. These very occasional defects in this phase of the pasta can have large implications in terms of the larger effects on the neutron star's crust and even observational properties, as electrons can scatter of of these ramps, which can also slow down the cooling rate of neutron stars. Other topics of research in this area include defining the shape of the matter at the [transition point](http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0408061) between two phases of nuclear pasta, as well as finding new phases altogether - e.g., [gyroid phase](http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2016), [waffle phase](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2551), [spongelike phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0311083v3), to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conductivity \n",
    "\n",
    "Crust conductivities, both thermal and electrical, are very important for determining greater properties of a neutron star. Thermal conductivity of the NS crust is important for determining the temperature profile of the entire star, and controls the cooling rate of the crust - something that is [observable](http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2603v2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Current research in this subject relates to performing more accurate approximations of the conductivities of the NS crust, based on the most up-to-date research on the crust and pasta structure. As discussed in the last section, impurities in the nuclear pasta have a large effect on the electrical and thermal conductivities in the mantle of the crust - in that the more disordered (more defects like the helical ramp) the nuclear pasta is, the [lower the conductivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2197v1). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Observational evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "**The biggest challenge in nuclear pasta research**, is the unfortunate question as to whether it exists or not (is this all for nothing?) Fortunately, there is a growing body of evidence providing links to the existence of exotic matter in the NS crust, as well as in supernovae (where similar densities are reached). It could be that researchers who have dedicated decades of their lives to learning about nuclear pasta are inclined to not publish papers on evidence *against* the existence, but I will still give a complete outline of the many different ways academics have inferred the presence of pasta in the universe from observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the previous section, nuclear pasta has a primary role in determining the [conductivity of a NSs crust](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2197). This leads directly into cooling effects, which [should](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.4875v2.pdf) be evident in observations of certain NSs. Sprouting from this idea - specific comparisons to measurements of stars have occurred, such as the observation of [rapid cooling in the crust](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2137) of a NS in the supernova remnant of Cassiopeia A, to provide some evidence for pasta's existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this, there have been several papers relating giant flares to pasta (a giant flare being a short burst of gamma ray radiation from a very magnetic neutron star). The author of these suggests that the oscillations of these bursts are [related to properties of the NS crust](http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2621), which can tell us things about whether or not pasta is present. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have also been a few papers about the effect of pasta on the spins of NSs. One author suggests that the evident limit on how fast X-ray NSs can spin (NSs which emit X-ray light) is due to an [amorphous layer of nuclear charge](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6546) - i.e., pasta. Additionally, one model for \"glitches\" (sudden changes in a NSs spin) is related to pasta [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2660v1)."

    "## Plasma Coupling Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Gamma$, the plasma coupling parameter, is a measure of the mean potential energy divided by the mean kinetic energy for particles in a one-component plasma (only one particle). This variable, which only depends on the temperature in a fixed simulation box, can tell you precisely what the melting point of a lattice structure will be, something that is easy to demonstrate in our molecular dynamics simulation. We have the following for its formal definition: $$\\Gamma=\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{1}{a k_B T}$$ where $T$ is the temperature of the particles in the simulation box, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity constant, and $a=(4\\pi n/3)^{-1/3}$ is the interparticle distance, for number density $n$ of particle in interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following property is of interest: When $\\Gamma$ is near to $175$, the one component plasma in question will behave crystallize into a lattice. As discussed in the next section, we have an easy way to test for this, with something called the *radial distribution function*. "

    "### Radial Distribution Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The radial distribution function, denoted $g(r)$, is simply a histogram of the distances between particles in a molecular dynamics simulation box normalized against a histogram for an ideal gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution tells you how often two atoms are within $r+dr$ distance of eachother, in reference to the distribution of an ideal gas. Continuing on our previous topic, if you see sharp peaks in the histogram, this will tell you that your particles have formed some sort of regular structure, such as a lattice. What we can then do, is demonstrate that as $\\Gamma \\nearrow 175$, we have that the plasma being measured will begin to show a spiked radial distribution function. "
